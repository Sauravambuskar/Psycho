## Troubleshooting

### TTS Server Issues
- **Port already in use**: Change port in `tts_server.py`

- **CORS errors**: Ensure TTS server is running on correct port
- **File upload issues**: Check file format and size limits

### Performance Optimization
- **Slow TTS**: Use faster models like Glow-TTS
